# Vex-Turning-Point-2018-19
All my code that I've written concerning Vex Turning Point

I've included the .h config files and .cpp main file for each program to view as well as the .vex file.
I'm honestly not sure if the .vex files will download and work correctly in VCS.

This is how I've implemented my ideas, and there are many other ways to accomplish the same. Use these as references and not ready code for your bot.
I for sure haven't commented on all of it and some of it might be difficult to understand.
Feel free to ask me any questions or advice on how to implement such techniques.
Hope this helps!
